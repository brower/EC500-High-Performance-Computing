This project is to explore a particular Machine Learning Optimaztion 
algorithm to implement for SVM (Sport Vector Machines)  training optimizer.  It will try to implement and call the rotuine from the Python code and write 
orginal one to see how they perform. This can be done my providing
synthetic data and in dual space introducing a linear solver with
the constraints.
